Bonin,"The inter-tropical convergence... look, we're in it, between 'Salpu' and 'Tasil.' And then, look, we're right in it..."
Robert,"Yes, let's call them in the back, to let them know..."
FA,Yes? Marilyn.
Bonin,"Yes, Marilyn, it's Pierre up front... Listen, in 2 minutes, we're going to be getting into an area where things are going to be moving around a little bit more than now. You'll want to take care."
FA,"Okay, we should sit down then?"
Bonin,"Well, I think that's not a bad idea. Give your friends a heads-up."
FA,"Yeah, okay, I'll tell the others in the back. Thanks a lot."
Bonin,I'll call you back as soon as we're out of it.
FA,Okay.
Bonin,Let's go for the anti-icing system. It's better than nothing.
Bonin,"We seem to be at the end of the cloud layer, it might be okay."
Robert,You can possibly pull it a little to the left.
Bonin,"You can possibly pull it a little to the left. We're agreed that we're in manual, yeah?"
Bonin,I have the controls.
Robert,Okay.
Robert,What's this?
Bonin,There's no good... there's no good speed indication.
Robert,"We've lost the, the, the speeds, then?"
Robert,Pay attention to your speed. Pay attention to your speed.
Bonin,"Okay, okay, I'm descending."
Bonin,Yeah.
Robert,"Descend... It says we're going up... It says we're going up, so descend."
Robert,Descend!
Bonin,"Here we go, we're descending."
Robert,Gently!
Bonin,"We're... yeah, we're in a climb."
Robert,"Damn it, where is he?"
Robert,Damn it!
Bonin,"I'm in TOGA, huh?"
Robert,"Damn it, is he coming or not?"
Robert,We still have the engines! What the hell is happening? I don't understand what's happening.
Bonin,"Damn it, I don't have control of the plane, I don't have control of the plane at all!"
Robert,Left seat taking control!
Captain,What the hell are you doing?
Bonin,We've lost control of the plane!
Robert,We've totally lost control of the plane. We don't understand at all... We've tried everything.
Robert,What do you think? What do you think? What should we do?
Robert,Climb... climb... climb... climb...
Bonin,But I've had the stick back the whole time!
Captain,"No, no, no... Don't climb... no, no."
Robert,"Descend, then... Give me the controls... Give me the controls!"
Robert,"Damn it, we're going to crash... This can't be happening!"
Bonin,But what's happening?
Captain,Ten degrees of pitch...
