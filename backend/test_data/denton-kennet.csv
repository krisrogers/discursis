1,JEFF KENNETT,
2,ANDREW DENTON,"Welcome, Jeff."
3,JEFF KENNETT,It's an absolute pleasure.
4,ANDREW DENTON,"Is it. You didn't really want to be here, did you."
5,JEFF KENNETT,No.
6,ANDREW DENTON,Why is that.
7,JEFF KENNETT,"Well...I've done this before many times, and I'm not in public life anymore. And I don't see much value for you or your audience in listening to me regurgitate the things that were part of my life with one exception. And that's the reason I am here. I am chairman of an organisation called Beyond Blue, which is the national depression initiative. And I've been..."
8,ANDREW DENTON,And we will get to all of that.
9,JEFF KENNETT,Shortly.
10,ANDREW DENTON,In good time.
11,JEFF KENNETT,I'm just answering your question.
12,ANDREW DENTON,"No, no, no. I appreciate that."
13,JEFF KENNETT,"I'm here because of my role there, which I take very seriously. And it does a lot of good work. And I thought, if this was a vehicle through which we could reach out to the 800,000 people who suffer depression every year, to offer them hope, then regardless of what I feel, personally, about doing an interview of this sort, then it's worth doing for the cause of depression."
14,ANDREW DENTON,"I want to cherry pick some of your life, because even though you know your story well, not necessarily everyone does."
15,JEFF KENNETT,"Oh, I don't think that's so. Most of you know my life, yes. See. Next subject."
16,ANDREW DENTON,"No. (Laughs) Alright. Billy McMahon for 20. No, no. You. '67, your dad enrolled you in the ANU, law, and you did a year of it. You didn't pass a course, bombed out. Why didn't you get on there."
17,JEFF KENNETT,"It's very hard for me to be in this position where I've got to correct you. Ah, I was enrolled. I got into the University of Canberra. I decided not to do university because I wasn't an academic. But I won a scholarship to an insurance organisation called Lumley's. In the meantime, I think my father had enrolled me or applied for me to be enrolled in ANU. And I went up there to study law. But on the way up, I met a chap in the seat next to me in the aircraft. And for the first time in my life, I reached for one of those alcoholic beverages. By the time I enrolled, I found myself doing economics, not law at all. And although I had a wonderful year, I didn't...was not able to pass a subject called statistics. And unless you passed statistics, you weren't able to sit your final...subjects in economics. And I think I got 13 per cent the first year...first term, and 26 the second. And the third, I got a lot of instruction. I got 86 for stats. I was really terribly proud. But I failed all my economics subjects. And I was given the option of coming back the next year. I said, ""No. I've had a year. I've blown it. I'll get out and get on with life."""
18,ANDREW DENTON,"And what you went on to, '68, was you were drafted. And you ended up at the officer trainee school at Skyville, which was a very, very tough course. I think half your intake pretty much dropped out. How tough was Skyville. I've heard there was the usual bastardisation, that you'd have your head held down a toilet for a week. Things like that."
19,JEFF KENNETT,The hair's never changed as a result.
20,ANDREW DENTON,"Perfect for cleaning the bowl, I would think."
21,JEFF KENNETT,"That's where it was always... (Laughs) That's where it was initially set... How tough was it. It was a good physical challenge. But, like anything else, if you're doing something for three months or six months or two years, you learn how to use your time more efficiently, to be more practical in what you're doing. So that the longer you're involved in an area of operation, you become more fluent in how to apply yourself. So over the six months, it became easier because you were smarter and better trained than when you were at the beginning."
22,ANDREW DENTON,But what did you have. You came second in your intake. What do you have.
23,JEFF KENNETT,Third.
24,ANDREW DENTON,"Third. Goodness me, the 'Age' was wrong."
25,JEFF KENNETT,"Your research is just hopeless tonight. I love the feeling...but yes, right."
26,ANDREW DENTON,"So says the expert on statistics. You came third in your intake, which is nonetheless impressive, because so many people dropped out. Why did you take to it. You did take to it. You loved it."
27,JEFF KENNETT,"Because I've always been of the view that whatever you do in life, you've got to do it to the best of your ability. My time at university may not stand as a testament to that. But life's very short. And, er, I think it is important that you use your time well. So if I was put in a situation for, as it was going to be then, two years, I thought it was better to try and qualify as an officer than not try and qualify as an officer. And if you were able to qualify as an officer, to try and do as well as you could."
28,ANDREW DENTON,"You ended up commanding a platoon. You came out of the army in 1970, the age of love for lots of people. What were you like with the girls. Did the girls like you."
29,JEFF KENNETT,"Oh, I can't remember. It's so long ago."
30,ANDREW DENTON,"Well, you met Felicity that year...1970."
31,JEFF KENNETT,"1970. Well, not quite correct. I'd actually met Felicity before I went away, and when she and I were both schoolchildren and we used to travel together on the same tram. But I was reintroduced to her when I returned."
32,ANDREW DENTON,You met her as a man that year.
33,JEFF KENNETT,"No, I met her as woman."
34,ANDREW DENTON,"Did you...how did you woo her, Jeffrey. What was your wooing."
35,JEFF KENNETT,"Ah, look, that's so long ago now. It's over 30 years."
36,ANDREW DENTON,No-one ever forgets that.
37,JEFF KENNETT,"Well, I'm not forgetting. But I'm not sharing it with you this evening."
38,ANDREW DENTON,What was your line. I mean...
39,JEFF KENNETT,"I can't remember, Andrew."
40,ANDREW DENTON,No.
41,JEFF KENNETT,No.
42,ANDREW DENTON,"""Look at my hair."" Anything like that."
43,JEFF KENNETT,Doubt it.
44,ANDREW DENTON,"No. You married, '75. Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm sure you will. You became the Member for Burwood."
45,JEFF KENNETT,Ah! (Laughs) When did we marry.
46,ANDREW DENTON,"Somewhere in between 1970... Oh, it was around '71, I think."
47,JEFF KENNETT,'72. Good. Yes.
48,ANDREW DENTON,"'72. There we go. Yes. ""It's time"", I think, was your slogan. Why do you love Felicity."
49,JEFF KENNETT,"Well, she's my wife. I had the world to choose from, and I chose her."
50,ANDREW DENTON,And why.
51,JEFF KENNETT,"I can't explain that to you, Andrew. You can dig away as much as you like. Why do you love Jennifer."
52,ANDREW DENTON,"Because Jennifer is a warm, vivacious, wonderful, sexy, hilarious, tremendous woman."
53,JEFF KENNETT,"They're exactly the words I would've used of Felicity. Exactly the words I would've used. No, it's...it's... We choose our partners for a whole range of different reasons. As I said, we've been fortunate. We've had 32 years and four children. And it's an absolute blessing. It's why, again, don't take anything for granted. You've got to work on things."
54,ANDREW DENTON,"I don't want to do a political interview, or go through your policies. And I'm sure you don't want to either. But what I would like to do is pick a few moments from your political career and ask you please to take us inside your head at those moments."
55,JEFF KENNETT,"Yeah, if the head can remember it. I'll do my best."
56,ANDREW DENTON,The head remembers every date that the head's ever been in.
57,JEFF KENNETT,"No, not necessarily. In fact, you find the head washes out those things that aren't relevant to living today. I mean, what's happened has passed. I can't change it. It's history."
58,ANDREW DENTON,Yeah.
59,JEFF KENNETT,"I can change the next hour, the next week. So I'll play your game."
60,ANDREW DENTON,Alright.
61,JEFF KENNETT,But I can't guarantee I'll remember as accurately as you think I...
62,ANDREW DENTON,"Well, I suspect you'll remember this moment. This is the response... The march up Bourke Street of 100,000 Victorians after your first hundred days in office. And I'm wondering...as you looked out the window at this extraordinary congregation, what you were thinking."
63,JEFF KENNETT,"I appreciated them being there. It was not unexpected. The union movement had fared very well under our predecessors. A change of government, and we'd embarked on some radical changes. But we'd prepared a long time for government. And we'd set our course. We knew what we had to do and we were going to do it. And I thought to myself... Because my window overlooked that crowd, and I was in the office with a couple of people. And I said to myself, ""Look, they've got a right to protest. But it's not gonna deter us from what we've got to do."" And I kept saying to my parliamentarians, ""It might take us three to four years before we can regain public support for what we're doing. But I can assure you, if we stay to the course that we've set, that that public support will return."""
64,ANDREW DENTON,"Next photo you're gonna go down a foxhole here, but stay with me. You and, er, John Howard. Now, I don't want to resurrect the entire story of the mobile phone call to Andrew Peacock. What I want to know is, after something like that goes public, even given the brutal cut and thrust of politics, how do you ever make it up with the man."
65,JEFF KENNETT,"Well, it goes back to my philosophy on life that I've tried to briefly explain to you. You live one day at a time. What happened yesterday, you can't change."
66,ANDREW DENTON,Could he do that too.
67,JEFF KENNETT,I think so.
68,ANDREW DENTON,'Cause you called him some extraordinary things...
69,JEFF KENNETT,"But you've got to remember that was a private phone call between two people that was picked up and was meant to be private. I used some colourful language and still, if I ever hear the tape, I wince at it. I'm sorry I ever did it. But it was a private conversation."
70,ANDREW DENTON,Mmm.
71,JEFF KENNETT,"I'm sure a lot of conversations you've had, you wouldn't want made public, or members of the audience. How do I live with it. Easily. Has it affected my relationship with John Howard. From my point of view, not at all. Has it affected his to me. I don't think so. I don't think there were many occasions and I can't think of any right now when someone said or did something to me that caused me great pain. Uh, the only time may have been when we lost the election in 1985 I'd been leader of the opposition for two or three years. I worked so hard, the party had been so demoralised. John Cain won so easily. And I remember I got through the Sunday after the election with all the media attention and everything alright. But on the Monday, I was in the foetal position I couldn't get out of bed. The pain was so great."
72,ANDREW DENTON,How long were you there for.
73,JEFF KENNETT,"Oh, a day, two days."
74,ANDREW DENTON,Wow.
75,JEFF KENNETT,"The pain was enormous. But that's all part of growing up, part of experience. I'm sure there are a lot of people who... sportsmen and women might have the same experience people in any walk of life. I mean, a lot of the people I deal with with depression are literally in a foetal position. They don't want to get out of bed. They can't. And you've got to somehow give them a reason to re-flourish."
76,ANDREW DENTON,Was that your only personal experience with depression.
77,JEFF KENNETT,"No, that wasn't... that wasn't clinical depression. That was emotional depression. Emotional depression... you lose your job, you can be down in the dumps. If you lose a relative, you can be down in the dumps a friend. The human body, mind, can work to adjust to that. Clinical depression is where you have a number of issues all coming together at the same time, and those ingredients may exist over a two, three, four, five-week period and then potentially get progressively worse. And for many people, the symptoms are different... Some are related to mind, some are related to issues to do with exercise, food, all sorts of things. But it's just an illness and, unfortunately, enough people don't present...to be correctly diagnosed, to be able to get on with their lives."
78,ANDREW DENTON,Why did the Beyond Blue people approach you.
79,JEFF KENNETT,They didn't.
80,ANDREW DENTON,You approached them.
81,JEFF KENNETT,"I started advocating, about two years before we lost office in 1999, the need to establish nationally a body addressing depression in our society. My daughter had come to me and said after two deaths of young men in the western district here in Victoria ""Dad, what are you gonna do to stop these deaths of young men."" When we looked at those two deaths, they weren't just car deaths, although they'd used their car, they were two young men who were so depressed they'd used their car to take their life. As a result of that, I started to look at suicide prevention and realising the title there was incorrect. We should be trying to prevent suicide and therefore deal with depression. Then I advocated it at the Premiers' Conference and we didn't get it up on the agenda. And after that, I decided, as part of our reward for our economic recovery here in Victoria, that I would commit a large sum of money to establish a national depression initiative here in Victoria for Australia, but we would fund it. You've got to understand, one in five will suffer from depression at some stage in life 800,000, in any one year, Australians. And, sadly, seven people every day are taking their own lives in Australia more than twice the road trauma. And you think of all the attention you hear about driving carefully, not drinking-driving, and, of course, nothing to do with depressive illnesses at all."
82,ANDREW DENTON,"This is a fantastic country to live in. We are very fortunate. Yet we have such a high, and rising, rate of youth suicide. What...why would that be in this country."
83,JEFF KENNETT,"We are seeing enormous social changes in Australia, which we haven't even started to address. We know farms have been getting smaller, people have been leaving the bush and going to larger cities and to metropolitan areas. But we're now finding that women in particular better educated, as they've every right to be are leaving the bush in order to pursue careers that are not offered in the bush. And a lot of young men, in particular, are finding it very difficult to attract the attention of a female partner. Or they're losing their partner, which is worse. That sends a lot of them into a depressed state and some of them to taking their own lives. So, you've got social changes. The second reason I think people are becoming depressed, particularly young children, is the expectations that are being put upon them. They're all expected to do exceedingly well, they're all expected to fit into a particular mould at school or whatever, instead of allowing their own personalities to develop and become tradespeople or become something else, as opposed to what Mum and Dad want them to be. And that's...a real worry because at school you're also finding many teachers are now devoting a lot of time not to teaching, but to the social condition of pupils that they've got, because the children are coming from broken homes or homes where, in fact, the marriage is not good. And they come... sometimes without food. So, you've got pressure... And the...other reason I'd give you, which...I don't know how we address it's the speed of change. There was a time when you got information, you could give thought to that piece of information before you had to respond to it. Now you almost have to do it instantaneously. You get information on the television, you get information on your computer you have to respond. No-one's thinking any longer. And that's why I say, you've got to make sure that you get your Yins and your Yangs in balance. There is no value in working so hard that you can't garden or play golf. I often say, with depression...that one of the best ways of avoiding depression is to be physically fit to walk every day, to do some exercise. The best example of that in this country, who do you think is at the moment."
84,ANDREW DENTON,John Howard.
85,JEFF KENNETT,"John Howard. Again, mid-60s, he walks every day...and yet, the Government or the community doesn't use that not for political reasons. If ever there was an important message being sent out by our most senior leader, it is John Howard walking every morning. If I want to help a lot of our aged from becoming depressed as they become aged and more and more are, particularly as they're taken out of their own environment I would say that they should follow John Howard's lead. And I don't understand why we spend so much money on health...and yet we spend so little on prevention of health illnesses. And...it's not difficult to do. Yet we wait until people need acute care before the system responds. Better people don't get ill. Better people don't get oppressed. And certainly, better people don't take their own lives."
86,ANDREW DENTON,"There's...was a fantastic passion in everything you just said then, and it was..."
87,JEFF KENNETT,"No doubt, you'll cut that out of the interview..."
88,ANDREW DENTON,"No, no, actually... I've gotta say..."
89,JEFF KENNETT,..and let all that other rubbish go forward.
90,ANDREW DENTON,I've gotta say...
91,JEFF KENNETT,That's what I was here for.
92,ANDREW DENTON,It was lovely to see that passion because...
93,JEFF KENNETT,Don't destroy it.
94,ANDREW DENTON,"We're not going to. In fact, compared to the dry, crusty politician I was getting for most of the interview, that was such a blessed bloody relief."
95,JEFF KENNETT,You were asking boring questions.
96,ANDREW DENTON,"They weren't boring questions at all. I mean, here you are, Jeff Kennett, with this magnificent, passionate plea to people to lead their lives and lead a rich life, and as soon as I ask you about yours, you shut up shop."
97,JEFF KENNETT,My life is mine.
98,ANDREW DENTON,Where is your life.!
99,JEFF KENNETT,"My life is here with you, Andrew. I can't tell you how stimulated I am by it. But I came here to talk about depression because I feel so strongly about it, and we can all do so much. The rest of it is rubbish. With due respect, it's history. No-one here's int... Half your audience were asleep. Right. You almost went to sleep at one stage."
100,ANDREW DENTON,Only twice.
101,JEFF KENNETT,"I think I did. But it's not relevant. What is relevant is what we can do for tomorrow. And in this area of health, whether it's mental health, whether it's ageing, whether it's health generally, there is so much more we can do."
102,ANDREW DENTON,"Let's talk about the future, then. You're 56."
103,JEFF KENNETT,Oh! Yes.
104,ANDREW DENTON,"Now, don't do that. What's this, ""Oh!""."
105,JEFF KENNETT,"Well, my future's irrelevant."
106,ANDREW DENTON,Goodness!
107,JEFF KENNETT,"Righto, go on."
108,ANDREW DENTON,"Is there anything about you that's relevant, Jeff."
109,JEFF KENNETT,Yeah. I'm still breathing.
110,ANDREW DENTON,Come on.
111,JEFF KENNETT,"No, no. I'm still breathing."
112,ANDREW DENTON,Your past is irrelevant. Your future's irrelevant.
113,JEFF KENNETT,My future's...
114,ANDREW DENTON,Do you like being irrelevant.
115,JEFF KENNETT,My past is irrelevant. I'm happy to talk about the future.
116,ANDREW DENTON,"You're 56, two-thirds of the way through your life, statistically."
117,JEFF KENNETT,"What makes you... Oh, statistically."
118,ANDREW DENTON,We know how good you are at statistics. So what's the big picture for Jeff Kennett.
119,JEFF KENNETT,"If the work of Beyond Blue can achieve the sort of results that I think are possible, I honestly feel that...to me, will be my most valuable work more important than being premier because it is so universal. So, to me, that is a big picture. There are lots of other issues that I could get involved in, but in terms of big picture, that would satisfy this humble little citizen."
120,ANDREW DENTON,"I think you may be right, and I love your passion for it. Jeffrey Kennett, thank you."
121,JEFF KENNETT,"Thank you, Andrew."
